# Personalized-Cancer-Diagnosis-Case-Study
Reducing the time taken by biologists to determine whether certain gene variation is a cancer or not, by 70% using Machine Learning.

Used various Machine learning algorithms to model the problem and bring down the log-loss to 1.05.

Also used Probability as output and feature importance, for better interpretation.
